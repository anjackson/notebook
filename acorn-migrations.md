Some collected notes on migrating BBC Micro and Acorn stuff.

Things to cover:

 - [BBC Micro Data Recovery](http://anjackson.net/keeping-codes/experiments/bbc-micro-data-recovery) linking in any new stuff.
 - Acorn floppies, why USB floppies can't be used, and what to do instead (OmniFlop on a PC with an internal drive, I think)
 - RiscPC disk imaging, and the LBA flag hack I needed to make it run in RPCEmu
