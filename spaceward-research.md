I found a more recent page with some details about the companies at: http://www.sintefex.com/?targ=contact&src=home

> "**Mike Kemp has had a long involvement with audio and the electronic arts dating from his university days when after graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, UK, with a Master of Arts in mathematics and computer science he turned down a research post at the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory to found his first studio business. He has mixed practical audio engineering with technical research and development in computer, audio and video fields.**

I emailed the contact email address in case I could reach Mike Kemp, but it seems unlikely to work.

Certainly, [it's too late to contact his co-founder Gary Lucas](https://x.com/morriswindsor/status/1015260568280846338?lang=en).

## Quantel vs Spaceward

> "Spaceward lost the case, lost their product, and I was officially branded a liar in Falconerâ€™s decision."

> "Adrian Wilson from [www.QuantelPaintbox.com](http://www.QuantelPaintbox.com) just sent me this cutting from 1989 when I organised a petition to save Spaceward, a company set up by a bunch of Cambridge scientists who invented some of the first CG software/hardware and who got me into the industry 40 years ago. They were taken to court by Quantel for infringing some of the patents."

## Satori Paint

According to http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Spaceward_Graphics and `dexvert` it seems Satori Paint can at least read `.rir` files and possibly `.r` files. I'm not sure about `.r` but the _Resolution Independent Raster_ files seem to be an interesting early vector image format, so converting those to e.g. TIFF would be quite lossy (although better than nothing). Possibly SVG is a better option. 

Hard to tell, the format is not easy to understand. I attempted a little reverse engineering, but could only discern some overall features and basic structure.
