## Quantel vs Spaceward

> "Spaceward lost the case, lost their product, and I was officially branded a liar in Falconerâ€™s decision."

> "Adrian Wilson from [www.QuantelPaintbox.com](http://www.QuantelPaintbox.com) just sent me this cutting from 1989 when I organised a petition to save Spaceward, a company set up by a bunch of Cambridge scientists who invented some of the first CG software/hardware and who got me into the industry 40 years ago. They were taken to court by Quantel for infringing some of the patents."
